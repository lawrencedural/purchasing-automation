# Columbia Spec Parser is Now Visible!

## ✅ What I Just Did

I've integrated the Columbia spec parser into your workflow. Here's what changed:

### Changes to `frontend/src/App.jsx`:

1. **Added Import:**
   ```javascript
   import { ColumbiaSpecStep } from './components/ColumbiaSpecStep'
   ```

2. **Added Step 8 to the steps array:**
   ```javascript
   { id: 8, title: 'Columbia Spec Parser', icon: FileText }
   ```

3. **Added rendering logic:**
   ```javascript
   {currentStep === 8 && <ColumbiaSpecStep />}
   ```

## 🎯 How to See It

### In Your UI:

1. The workflow now has 8 steps instead of 7
2. Scroll to the right in the step bar to see "Columbia Spec Parser"
3. Or navigate to it by clicking "Next Step" 8 times
4. Or click directly on step 8 in the progress bar

### What It Looks Like:

```
Progress Bar:
[Step 1] → [Step 2] → ... → [Step 7] → [Step 8: Columbia Spec Parser] ← NEW!
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Option 1: Navigate Through the Workflow

1. Start at Step 1
2. Click "Next Step" repeatedly
3. You'll reach Step 8: Columbia Spec Parser
4. Upload your test file: `test_data/sample_columbia_spec.txt`

### Option 2: Jump Directly

You can modify the starting step temporarily:

```javascript
// In App.jsx, line 11
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(8)  // Start at Columbia step
```

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

1. **Refresh your browser** (if app is already running)
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Navigate to Step 8:**
   - Click through all steps, OR
   - Temporarily set `currentStep` to 8 in code

3. **You should see:**
   - ✅ "Columbia Sportswear Specification Parser" as the title
   - ✅ Upload area with drag & drop
   - ✅ Tip about file formats

4. **Upload test file:**
   - `test_data/sample_columbia_spec.txt`
   - Should parse and display data

## 🐛 If You Don't See It

### Check Imports

Make sure these files exist:
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/ColumbiaSpecStep.jsx`
- ✅ `frontend/src/parsers/specParser.js`
- ✅ `frontend/src/utils/dataExporter.js`

### Check Browser Console

Open DevTools (F12) and check for errors:
```
ERROR: Cannot find module './components/ColumbiaSpecStep'
```

If you see this, the file doesn't exist in that location.

### Rebuild Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
